# File-Carving
Video file carving is a technique used in digital forensics to recover deleted or damaged video files from a storage deice like a disk. It involves analyzing the file system and/or the raw data on the storage device to locate fragments or whole blocks of data that may belong to a video file. The carved data is then reconstructed and extracted into a playable video file. It cane be a can be a useful technique in digital forensics, data recovery, and criminal investigations, as it can help to recover important evidence that might otherwise be lost. However, it can also be a time-consuming and complex process that requires specialized tools and expertise to perform accurately. The process of video file carving requires specialized software tools and a deep understanding of file system structures and data recovery techniques.
Our project is an attempt to build a forensic tool that aids in video file carving
The project is divided into 3 stages:
## STAGE-1 : 
## STAGE-2 
## STAGE-3
